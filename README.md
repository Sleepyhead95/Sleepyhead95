- 👋 Hi, I’m Janka
- 🎨 I transitioned to tech from a background in art history. It's been quite a journey but I think it was the best decision.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and I do graphic/web design in my free time. I am currently a Frontend developer, but I'm learning to become full-stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React refactoring and advanced Laravel
- 📫 Follow me on X where I post my daily tech shenanigans: https://twitter.com/antalova_janka
- ⚡ Fun fact: HTML is a programming language
